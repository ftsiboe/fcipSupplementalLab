**fcipSupplementalLab** is a research framework for analyzing
supplemental crop insurance products within the United States **Federal
Crop Insurance Program (FCIP)**.

The repository supports reproducible, policy-oriented analysis of how
supplemental coverage options affect producer behavior, actuarial
performance, public–private risk sharing, and federal fiscal exposure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scope and Research Questions

This project focuses on the following analytical dimensions:

- **Adoption and demand**
  - Uptake of supplemental products (e.g., ECO, SCO, MCO)
  - Coverage-level substitution and plan choice
- **Actuarial performance and program soundness**
  - Loss ratios, dispersion, tail risk, and persistence
  - Rating performance relative to underlying risk
- **Fiscal exposure**
  - Federal premium subsidies and indemnity outlays
  - Budget risk under alternative policy designs
- **Risk reduction and income transfer**
  - Mean revenue effects and volatility reduction
  - Income transfer magnitude and distribution
- **Basis risk and coverage quality**
  - Alignment between realized losses and indemnities
  - Design efficiency and spatial/temporal basis risk
